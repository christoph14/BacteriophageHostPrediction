    "In this part, the models are trained, tuned and tested using 4-fold nested cross-validation. In sklearn, nested cross-validation works by chaining GridSearchCV and cross_val_score together. In GridSearchCV, we have to declare the parameters which we want to tune (param_grid). Additionally, the features need to be standardized first. It is good practice to only seperate training and test data in this standardization, because otherwise information of the test set 'leaks' to the training set. To be completely unbiased, we should peform the exact same transformation on training data and afterwards on the test data. Sklearn makes it easy to implement this using a pipeline. In the pipeline, the data is standardized first, and then the model is constructed. This pipeline can then serve as input for GridSearchCV."
